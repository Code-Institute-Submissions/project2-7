#Project 2

This is a data visualization project. It makes it easier to analyse the relationship of the data between different variables and analyse the variable on its own. The project also shows each discipline performs along different variables.

#UX

The project has a very good user experience. By selecting the discipline, which is gender type in this case one can visualize how it performs along different variables. One can visualize the number of male and female, the average height of each group and also the scatter plot of the discipline.

If both disciplines are selected the comparison between the disciplines can me made via a bar graph. The number of men and women in the study can be easily visualized and compared using a bar graph. The difference between average heights of disciplines is also analysed using bargraphs.

The relationship between the height and weight of each discipline can be compared. The disciplined can be visualized using a different colour. In this case in the scatter plot pink colour is for female and blue is for male discipline.
The visualization of all the three plots is analyzed and written down in the website.

#Features

##Existing Features

Discipline Selector- Allows the user to select which discipline she wants to analyse

Bar graphs- They compare the data between the two disciplines. The first bar chart compares the number of men and women in the study. The second compares their average heights.

Scatter plot- compares the relationship between height and weight for each gender. 

##Features left to Implement

Bar chart â€“ to compare weights between disciplines

#Technologies used

JQuery https://jquery.com/ was used to simplify the manipulation of the DOM

HTML was also used

Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/ was used as a framework

#Testing

BrushOn- If a brushOn in the coding was set to true then placing a pointer in any of the dots in the scatter plot will not any information. After setting it to false the pointer tells us the gender that the dot represents and the height in question

Discipline selection- Selecting one discipline result in a single bar been shown in any graph and scatter dot that are appearing will only for one colour. Changing to both plots then all the bars and dots appears.

Barchart- Clicking on one bar allows only one discipline bar and dots to appear like in the discipline selection.
